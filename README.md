# GreenhouseLight-Heat

# Introduction
Here we are controlling the light, heat and humidity inside a greenhouse. This way we optimise plant growth all year round, day in and out. We control the light by shading the plants, or adding blue and red LED's. The heat by adding warmth trough electric heaters, or cool it down by opening window(s). And we also want to decrease humidity by opening those same window(s). All of these factors are controlled by the by sensors made by the GreenhouseSensoring team.
