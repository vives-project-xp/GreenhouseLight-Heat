# Heater guide

## Requirements

1. **Smart Plug**: we used the [Wiz smart plug](https://www.hubo.be/nl/p/wiz-smart-plug-stekker/943560/?srsltid=AfmBOop1jMLLTrlQRWXBZI4sboYYit9EBC_hZCbBdXXBF2tYZz2Lpcub) which is easy to install with a simple guide that comes with the product.
2. **Heater**: we used a [Vonroc heater](https://www.brico.be/nl/tuin-terras-buitenleven/terrasverwarming/terrasverwarmers-accessoires/terrasverwarmers/vonroc-heater-marsili-compact-2000w-zwart/10138731#specs) because it has a IP55 which is good for outdoor use.
3. **ESP-32**: this is to control the smart plug.

## Step 1: Set up the smart plug.

There is an easy installation guide that comes with the product itself. Just plug the smart plug in an outlet and open the app, then click on the plus icon to connect a device, choose for a smart plug. Then you can choose to set it up manually by clicking on the 3 stripes on the rop left corner. Set up the wifi and complete the guide.
